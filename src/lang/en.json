  "home.Disclaimer": "Our greatest wish is to enhance the community's knowledge as well as help ALS and other neurodegenerative patients have more useful information, hope and optimism on their healing journey. We make an effort to provide objective and accurate information to help them lead a better life. We connect and learn from ALS winners and experts while also reviewing relevant research findings around the world to provide ALS patients and their families with evidence of ALS reversal or deceleration. In addition, we encourage readers to find new solutions and ideas from different learning resources and to be open-minded towards the possible solutions for an effective curing process. However, we have no authority to diagnose or treat this disease. Therefore, patients and their family members should consult medical experts before carrying out a new treatment method.",

  "home.BrieflyAboutALS": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages the brain and spinal cord nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscles leading to muscular dystrophy and gradual weakening. In the early stages, the most common symptoms for ALS correlate with various muscle malfunction, such as stiff muscles and muscle twitching. While ALS progression might be variable from one person to another, treatment can extend patientsâ€™ life, along with better living conditions.",
